# Money Calculators UK (prototype)

A dark, neon fintech-style calculator hub for UK money nerds.

**Goal:** lots of useful UK calculators in one place (educational estimates, not financial advice).

## What’s in v0.1
- UK take‑home pay calculator (England/Wales/NI)
  - Income tax + employee NI (simplified)
  - Clear assumptions panel
  - Unit-tested calculation core

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tests
```bash
npm run test:run
```

## Notes / disclaimers
This project is for education and estimation. Not financial advice.
Always verify results against payroll/HMRC and your own situation.

## Next calculators to add
- Pay rise impact (marginal rate visual)
- Pension contribution impact (salary sacrifice vs net pay vs relief-at-source — with a "not sure" mode)
- Compound interest / savings growth
- Emergency fund runway
